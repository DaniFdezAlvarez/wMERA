This code is not thougth to be final. Efficiency, arquitechture and code structure should be improved.

## Researching about musical entities conciliation

* Target: prototype able to recognize dirty/heterogeneus (civil names, artistic names, alias) strings as entities (groups, songs, artists, releases,...).

* Content: The different packages contain executable scripts in python doing the task related with the package's name but most of them are based in private files non included in this repo. Those scripts are called main.py or main_*.py

* Collaborators: [Dani Fernández](https://github.com/DaniFdezAlvarez), [Dani Gayo](https://github.com/danigayo), [José Labra](https://github.com/labra).
